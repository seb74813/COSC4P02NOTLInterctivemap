Proposal
Scrum Board: https://www.flyingdonut.io/app/projects/63c5bfd0d0fe6a62d07b947c

Objective
Problem:      The existing maps of the NotL Museum lack detail, especially the english version. If a visitor wanted to see what kind of exhibits are on display, 
            the current map gives little explanation, as well as lacking key information like restrooms.
            
Objective:    Design an interactive map of the Niagara-on-the-lake Museum 

Importance:   History has many important lessons that can be taught to future generations for them to learn. 
            With the growing use of technology in everyonesâ€™ day-to-day lives, being able to similarly incorporate technology to assist with teaching this history
            is becoming increasingly important. An interactive map to do such with will not only be a means to initiate that change, but also, the software itself 
            can help future generations learn the important lessons found in the past.

Description:  An interactive online map, with clickable elements that allow digital visitors to view exhibit descriptions, general layout, and other 
            important locations in the museum.
